### Project Description: House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict house prices using a variety of machine learning models. The dataset consists of housing features, including numerical and categorical variables, and a target variable representing house prices.

#### Key Steps in the Project:

### Data Loading & Preparation

•The dataset is loaded from CSV files (train.csv and test.csv).

•The train and test datasets are combined for preprocessing.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

•Basic data overview: shape, data types, missing values, and quantile statistics.

•Identification of categorical, numerical, and high-cardinality categorical features.

•Summary statistics and visualizations for both categorical and numerical variables.

•Correlation analysis and feature relationships.

#### Feature Engineering

•Handling outliers by identifying and replacing extreme values.

•Managing missing values through imputation strategies (e.g., filling missing categorical values with "No").

•Encoding categorical variables for machine learning models.

### Model Training & Evaluation

•Multiple regression models are trained, including:

•Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

•K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), XGBoost, and LightGBM

•Performance evaluation is done using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

•Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

### Goal

The ultimate goal is to develop a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts house prices based on various features. The project explores different algorithms, feature engineering techniques, and evaluation metrics to achieve optimal results.
